## Major Tasks

1. Add a harness for Equality between YYP-Bosses
   1. A { Yyp Boss} :: B{ Yyp Boss }
   2. Add the same sprite to both
   3. A != B
   4. A and B will generate different UUIDs in their sprite add process.
   5. Therefore, we need some sort of harness, so our Yyp-Bosses can be compared.
2. Add unit tests to the Sprite Add Function
3. Add back in Trailing Commas on Serialization.
4. Add template strings for new Yyp files
5. Add template strings for new Yy files

3. Type the blendmode of each layer in GMS2 Sprite Editor
4. Add Doc Linting Level
5. Camelcasing of `backdrop_y_offset` and the like
